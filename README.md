# ASKAP-FLASH data validation

11 Nov 2020, written by Hyein Yoon

- Each directory contains a validation output report from each SBID.

- At this stage, this validation script just focuses on a successful/efficient run and shows what kind of plots are currently included.

- As there are missing askapsoft outputs to run the script completely now, some dummy data/plots are used.

- Hence, please do not focus too much on the meaning of specific plots and output number.
