- Each directory contains a validation output report of each SBID.

- Now this validation script is just focusing on successful/efficient run.

- At this stage, there are some missing askapsoft outputs to run the script completely. 

- Hence, I used some dummy data/plots. Please do not focus on the meaning of each plot and output number.
